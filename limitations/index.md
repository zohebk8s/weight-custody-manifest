# Limitations

The canonical, complete list is [`LIMITATIONS.md`](https://github.com/agentrust-io/weight-custody-manifest/blob/main/LIMITATIONS.md). The load-bearing ones:

- **No custody against a customer-controlled release authority.** A customer who can read KBS/Trustee keys or replace its verifier and policy can bypass the gate without defeating hardware attestation. The reference server does not implement protected KBS provisioning. See the [deployment trust checklist](https://wcm.agentrust-io.com/deployment-trust/index.md).
- **No custody against a hardware owner.** Against a physical operator who owns the box, cheap published memory-bus attacks (TEE.fail, BadRAM) extract the key and can forge attestation. WCM offers cost, detection, containment, legal recourse, and mandatory physical hardening there - not silicon-enforced custody.
- **Attestation forgery, open half.** Measurement forgery is detectable (`memory_fingerprint_challenge`); the key-extraction half is not, and is why publication is staged (open question 8.8).
- **The platform we validate against does not meet our own ciphertext-hiding precondition.** SPEC §3.6 conditions the semi-trusted-operator custody claim on SEV-SNP ciphertext hiding being enabled. The live Azure CVM this SDK is validated against reports `PLATFORM_INFO = 0x25`: alias check set, ciphertext hiding **clear**. Require it with `release_policy.platform_integrity.ciphertext_hiding` rather than assuming it.
- **Attestation-key revocation is weaker than the compensating control implies.** Verified 2026-09-11: every certificate in our captured H100 chain carries `notAfter = 9999-12-31`, both NVIDIA CRLs are empty with a two-year next-update, AMD VCEKs carry serial number zero so a CRL entry cannot name a chip, and on no vendor can the operator invoke revocation.
- **Trusted time is an assumption.** Wipe-on-lapse bounds exposure only if the clock cannot be stalled; the SDK reports the floor (`time_floor`) but cannot make an untrusted clock trustworthy.
- **In-envelope distillation is not prevented.**
- **GPU-side quote verification is cryptographic only when a device root is configured.** `NvidiaGpuVerifier` verifies the device chain, the ECDSA P-384 report signature and the raw nonce at offset 4, and is validated on a live H100 capture and an H200. A gate built without `build_gpu_verifier` falls back to structural trust, and `gpu_report_verified` says so.
- **Azure CVMs** use a vTPM-rooted attestation path (`AzureSnpVtpmProvider`), not `/dev/sev-guest`; `REPORT_DATA` is paravisor-bound there.
