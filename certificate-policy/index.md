# Provider certificate policy

WCM rejects X.509 certificates whose serial number is zero or negative. RFC 5280 requires positive serial numbers, and supporting non-conforming provider certificates would make behavior dependency-version-specific.

`cryptography` 50 warns while loading these certificates; its announced version 51 behavior is to reject them. WCM isolates both behaviors behind one loader and returns the same non-sensitive, fail-closed policy error. It does not rewrite the certificate or skip any chain, signature, validity, or revocation check.

Until version 51 is published, the runtime dependency remains capped below it. CI exercises the real version-50 warning path and an executable model of the documented version-51 load-time exception. The cap must not be lifted until CI can replace that model with the released dependency. Fixtures contain generated names and keys only—never raw provider tokens, tenant identifiers, or environment identifiers.
