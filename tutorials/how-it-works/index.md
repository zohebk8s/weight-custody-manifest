# How WCM works (the six steps)

A plain-language tour of the flow. Nothing here assumes cryptography background; the [runnable examples](https://github.com/agentrust-io/examples/tree/main/weight-custody-manifest) then run it for real.

## The problem, in one sentence

When a model builder deploys weights into **someone else's** infrastructure (on-prem, sovereign cloud, air-gapped), the usual trust direction flips: the party at risk is the **builder**, whose weights now sit on hardware and operators it does not control. WCM is the protocol for that direction.

## The cast

- **Builder** - signs off on which weights and which serving stack are approved.
- **Custodian** - operates the key broker (KBS) that gates release. Jointly signs the manifest with the builder so neither acts alone.
- **Customer / operator** - runs the enclave on their own hardware. They are the party being constrained, so they never sign the manifest alone.
- **KBS** - the key broker: issues challenges, verifies attestation, releases the decryption key only into a verified enclave.

For an open-weight deployment these roles often collapse into one enterprise governance function (see the [runnable examples](https://github.com/agentrust-io/examples/tree/main/weight-custody-manifest)).

## The six steps

These steps assume a release authority the builder trusts. If the customer controls the broker's keys and verification settings, co-signing a manifest does not prevent that customer from bypassing it. Customer-hosted attested KBS operation is specified as a design, but the reference server does not implement its protected provisioning boundary. See [who controls key release](https://wcm.agentrust-io.com/deployment-trust/index.md).

**0. Certify - the manifest.** The builder writes a signed manifest: the `weights_hash`, the release terms (license, permitted derivatives), and the release policy (which hardware, which serving-image measurement, trusted-time source). It is signed **jointly** by builder and custodian. This is the enforceable, machine-checkable version of the deployment agreement.

**1. Verify - is this the real manifest?** Anyone can check the joint signature: both the builder and the custodian (and the sovereign signer, under the sovereign profile) must have signed, over the exact bytes. A tampered manifest does not verify.

**2. Gate - attestation-gated release.** The KBS issues a single-use nonce. The enclave returns evidence: a CPU confidential-VM quote and a *separate* GPU report, both echoing the nonce. The KBS checks all of it - genuine hardware, the platform the manifest requires, and a serving-image measurement matching what the builder signed - and only then releases the decryption key into the enclave. The key decrypts weights **only** under the builder-signed, measured serving stack, so "no raw weight export path" can be a real property, not a promise.

**3. Custody - wipe-on-lapse.** The enclave holds the key only for the manifest's attestation cadence window. If it does not re-attest in time, it **zeroizes** the key from its own memory and stops authorizing inference - the key is gone, not suspended - and invokes the teardown adapter the deployment supplied to stop its serving worker. This bounds worst-case exposure to one cadence window even if a compromised host blocks every revocation signal, *provided the clock cannot be stalled* (`trusted_time_source`).

**4. Terms - license and field-of-use.** The manifest's `release_terms` carry the license and usage restrictions; release happens only under the disclosed, conforming configuration. The manifest turns contract text into a technical release condition.

**5. Derive - lineage.** If the customer is permitted to fine-tune inside the enclave, the result gets its own manifest with `derived_from` pointing at the parent and a `rights_holder` recording the IP split - a chain of custody back to the original.

**6. Revoke - the kill switch.** Either party (or the sovereign quorum) can revoke; the enclave ends custody and tears serving down on the next cadence lapse at the latest. Wipe-on-lapse is the floor underneath revocation.

## The honesty at the center

WCM never claims silicon-enforced custody against an operator who **physically owns the hardware**. Cheap published attacks (TEE.fail, BadRAM) defeat current confidential-computing silicon. Against that adversary WCM offers cost, detection, containment, legal recourse, and mandatory physical hardening - not cryptographic custody. See [Limitations](https://wcm.agentrust-io.com/limitations/index.md) and `SPEC.md` §3.6.

## Closed vs open weights

For a **closed** model, steps 0-2 are doing secrecy work: keep the weights hidden. For an **open** model the base weights are public, so that secrecy is theater - but the same steps still do integrity, license, and (above all) derivative-custody work. That flip is shown in the [runnable open-model example](https://github.com/agentrust-io/examples/tree/main/weight-custody-manifest).
