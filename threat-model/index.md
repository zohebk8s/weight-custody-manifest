# Threat model

The full threat model is [`THREAT-MODEL.md`](https://github.com/agentrust-io/weight-custody-manifest/blob/main/THREAT-MODEL.md). A map of every threat to what the SDK actually enforces is in the [implementation audit](https://github.com/agentrust-io/weight-custody-manifest/blob/main/python/docs/threat-model-implementation-audit.md).

## Assets

Decrypted weights, the decryption key, manifest integrity, attestation quotes, audit receipts, derivative weights, and signing keys.

## Adversaries

A malicious or compromised customer operator (privileged on the host), a malicious custodian insider, a network adversary, a malicious or coerced builder (the sovereign case), a co-located side-channel tenant, and a supply-chain attacker.

## The load-bearing assumption

The model owner must trust the key-release authority. A customer who can read the model key or replace KBS/Trustee verification and policy can bypass workload attestation without attacking the TEE. Internal separation of administrators does not protect against the entity that can override them. See the [deployment configurations and checklist](https://wcm.agentrust-io.com/deployment-trust/index.md).

WCM's guarantees hold only as far as the trusted computing base does. The honest core: current confidential-computing silicon does **not** protect the key or attestation integrity against an operator who physically owns the hardware (TEE.fail, BadRAM). Against that adversary WCM provides cost, detection, containment, legal recourse, and mandatory physical hardening - not cryptographic custody. See [Limitations](https://wcm.agentrust-io.com/limitations/index.md).
