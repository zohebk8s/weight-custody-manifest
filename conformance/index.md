# Schema and conformance

Two machine-readable artifacts sit alongside the specification text, so an independent implementation has something to build and check against rather than prose to interpret.

## The manifest JSON Schema

[`schema/wcm-manifest-v1.schema.json`](https://github.com/agentrust-io/weight-custody-manifest/blob/main/schema/wcm-manifest-v1.schema.json) is the normative machine-readable form of `SPEC.md` §3.1. JSON Schema 2020-12, identified by `https://wcm.agentrust-io.com/schema/manifest/v1.json`.

It is **frozen at v1 and additive-only**. Fields and permitted enum values may be added; nothing is removed, renamed, made required, narrowed, or repurposed. A breaking change would publish `.../manifest/v2.json` alongside rather than edit v1. The specification itself is still pre-1.0, so this is a deliberate trade: implementers get a stable target now, and whatever the spec grows into arrives as an addition.

From Python:

```
from wcm.schema import manifest_schema
schema = manifest_schema()
```

**One constraint is not expressible in JSON Schema:** `derived_from` must not equal `weights_hash`. Standard JSON Schema cannot compare the values at two instance locations, so this stays a verifier-side check. It matters, because a self-derived manifest makes the lineage walk in §3.4 non-terminating. An implementation that delegates all structural validation to the schema will fail the corresponding conformance vector. See [`schema/README.md`](https://github.com/agentrust-io/weight-custody-manifest/blob/main/schema/README.md).

## The conformance suite

[`conformance/`](https://github.com/agentrust-io/weight-custody-manifest/tree/main/conformance) holds language-neutral JSON vectors and a scoring contract. Four levels are defined, matching the four protocol layers:

| Level | Title                        | Vectors | Shape     |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| L1    | Manifest and joint signature | 32      | documents |
| L2    | Attestation-gated release    | 37      | scenarios |
| L3    | Runtime custody              | 12      | scenarios |
| L4    | Derivative lineage           | 10      | documents |

91 vectors. All four levels are vectored and every reportable error code is exercised by at least one vector, which a test enforces. L1 and L4 ask a question about a document. L2 and L3 ask what a system does over *time*, so their vectors are ordered scenarios with an injected clock and named nonces: a nonce is single-use, a lease lapses, an operation budget runs down.

Two limits remain, and `wcm conformance` prints both on every full run rather than leaving a green result to be over-read:

- **The quote vectors use a synthetic PKI**, not vendor roots. They prove an implementation verifies a certificate chain, a report signature and a `REPORT_DATA` nonce binding correctly. They do not prove it can parse a real AMD, Intel or NVIDIA quote, which is vendor-format work the SDK covers with committed real-silicon fixtures.
- **GPU-side cryptographic verification is not vectored.** The quote vectors cover the CPU quote; the NVIDIA device chain is covered by the SDK's H100 fixture.

Running it:

```
pip install weight-custody-manifest

wcm conformance                              # self-test this SDK
wcm conformance --level L4
wcm conformance --list-vectors
wcm conformance --list-codes

wcm conformance --results my-results.json    # score another implementation
```

An implementation in any language reads the vectors, emits a results file naming each vector's verdict and, for a rejection, its `WCM-*` code, and gets scored. Three rules make a pass mean something: every valid input must be accepted, every invalid one must be rejected *for the declared reason*, and a vector with no reported result counts as a failure. So neither "reject everything" nor a partial submission can claim a level.

The error codes are listed in [`conformance/codes.md`](https://github.com/agentrust-io/weight-custody-manifest/blob/main/conformance/codes.md), and the full contract, including two interop details that trip implementations (defaults must be materialized before the signing pre-image is computed, and the self-derivation check has to live outside the schema), is in [`conformance/README.md`](https://github.com/agentrust-io/weight-custody-manifest/blob/main/conformance/README.md).
